	<h3>About us</h3>
	<p>We understand that most freelancers donâ€™t like dealing with the business side of things. It can be time consuming and stressful. You should focus on what you do best, being creative. We will focus on the business side: negotiating contracts, preparing invoices, engaging in hours of back and forth communication with clients, and perhaps the most frustrating, payment collection.</p>
